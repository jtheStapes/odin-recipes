# odin-recipes
My first HTML project

Using what I learned from The Odin Project, I was able to create a webpage with three links to three different recipes found on allrecipes.com.
I used h1 and h2 headings, ordered and unordered lists, a tags to create links to different pages, and inserted images onto each page.
